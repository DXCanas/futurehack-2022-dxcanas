## Motive



## Implementation
Automated pipeline, used in a theoretical product that receives emails from product mailing lists, hackernews, and other popular dev venues to hear about the latest developments in the industry.

After receiving the email, this tool would automatically modify the URLs to point at the hypothes.is (maybe genius.com?) servers; as a result, all the links would go to crowd-annotatable versions of the source site.

After modifying the bodies, the emails can be forwarded over to a subscriber. Over time (after analytics start identifying common bits of jargon), a glossary can be appended to the bottom of the same email body. Maybe even take a Pocket approach where a weekly/monthly "best of"/most-clicked-on secondary email list could be put together.

The idea here is to encourage questions and discussion on these articles, so the peopel who receive the last email have an opportunity to ask questions, creating an opportunity to decrypt the alphabet soup.

Like (Firefox Relay)[relay.firefox.com] or (Simple Login)[simplelogin.io], but explantion/education minded rather than privacy-minded.
